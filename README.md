# AniVerma17
My personal space to showcase my works, the experiences I collect, with some fun stuff in between ;).

Built as an SPA with just core HTML, CSS and JavaScript; with Markdown for content and a lot of symlinks hack for URL routing (Did this just for fun and out of craziness, don't try this for any real-world application xD).
