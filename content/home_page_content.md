### I'm

# Animesh Verma

A normal techie with abnormal quirks, exploring techs and trying to figure out life, often tinkering with the interesting stuff.  
I usually work on development of web and mobile apps at full-stack level, but occasionally take a dive into cybersecurity and do some reverse engineering of apps for fun.
